RPGNU Library is a C++ framework to develop 2D and 3D RPG games, multi-thread, multi-platform and extensible (scripts).

We have several targets, including:

  * Comfort

  * Extensible

  * Flexible

  * Multi-platform

  * Standards-based

To ensure the comfort we think it need be Intuit, Practical and Simple.

Intuit implies "all will be in it's site".

Practical implies it will facilitate the writing of simple code, legible.

Simple implies it will be very legible. So we try to don't use complex class names and variables names.

Extensible implies it will support script systems and implies it assure us it will be easily extended. So when we write it, we think: "Ok, if in the future we want extend this, this will be possible? and this will be easy?"

Flexible implies it will adaptable for you.

Multi-platform implies it will can used in many OS and architectures.

Standards-based implies it will use 'only' standards tools, such OpenGL. But actually we use non-standard tools, because we don't know use the standards tools very well.

With all this, we want RPGNU allow you write complex RPG games, not only simples.

Actually it is under constantly restructuring, but the final structure is very close.

Have fun!
